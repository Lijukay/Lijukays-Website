    <h2>About this page</h2>
    <p>
      This page has been created by Lijukay in order to learn html (and html
      ONLY). However, it could be, that this page uses files with other
      programming-languages. The main focus is not on these files. I am just
      learning with a YouTube video that includes some of these things.

      <h2>Some html-things</h2>
      <!--This is creating a less big headline-->
      <p>Here are some basics you might want to know about html:</p>
      <!--This creates a normal text line-->
      <ul>
        <li>
          Text between &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;/h1&gt; is shown as a big title. This
          'h1'-tag is only used once a page mostly
        </li>
        <li>
          Text between &lt;h2&gt; and &lt;/h2&gt; is shown as a less big title
          than what the h1-tag offers and is used more often
        </li>

        <li>
          Text between &lt;h3&gt; and &lt;/h3&gt; is shown as a even lesser big
          title.
        </li>

        <li>The tag &lt;br&gt; creates a break (A new line)</li>

        <li>The text between &lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt; is <em>italic</em></li>

        <li>
          The text between &lt;strong&gt; and &lt;/strong&gt; is shown
          <strong>bigger</strong>
        </li>

        <li>
          An unordered list can be created by using &lt;ul&gt; and &lt;/ul&gt;
          <br />To list things, between these tags, create &lt;li&gt; and
          &lt;/li&gt; and write the list-item between it
        </li>

        <li>
          The tag &lt;abbr&gt; or &lt;/abbr&gt; is creating showing the website,
          that this is an abbriviation. It requires the attribute title followed
          by the explanation of the abbriviation, which is visible in the
          website by hovering above the abbriviation. For example:
          <br />&lt;abbr title="by the way"&gt;btw&lt;/em&gt; gives you
          following output: <br /><abbr title="by the way">btw</abbr>
        </li>

        <li>
          Text between &lt;address&gt; and &lt;/address&gt; is counted as an
          address by the browser. For example:
          <address>60 Broadway, London, W81 0QI</address>
        </li>

        <li>
          &lt;section id=""&gt; and &lt;/section&gt; with
          <strong>everything</strong> the section should include in between
          these tags creates sections you can refer to with the &lt;a
          href="<em>id</em>"&gt; and &lt;/a&gt; tags by changing
          <em>id</em> with # followed by the id of the section is
        </li>

        <li>
          &lt;a href="<em>link</em>"&gt; and &lt;/a&gt; creates a clickable
          thing that leads you to whatever <em>link</em> is.
        </li>

        <li>
          &lt;a href="<em>link</em>" download&gt; and &lt;/a&gt; creates a
          clickable thing that lets you download whatever <em>link</em> is:
          <br />
          Download <a href="screenshot.png" download>Screenshot</a>
        </li>

        <li>
          &lt;a href="<em>mailto:link</em>"&gt; and &lt;/a&gt; creates a
          clickable thing that lets you email whatever <em>link</em> is as long
          as mailto: is mentioned: <br />
          Email me at <a href="mailto:random@email.com">email</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          &lt;a href="<em>tel:link</em>"&gt; and &lt;/a&gt; creates a clickable
          thing that lets you call whatever <em>link</em> is as long as tel: is
          present: <br />
          Call <a href="tel:+000000000" download>Me</a>
        </li>

        <li>
          &lt;a href="<em>link</em>" target="_blank"&gt; and &lt;/a&gt; creates
          a clickable thing that lets you open whatever <em>link</em> is in a
          new tab: <br />
          Open <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Google</a>
        </li>

        <li>
          With &, you can create some special things for your application, based
          on the string-"code" that follows. For example: <br />&nbsp;nbsp;
          creates a non-breaking-space, so a space
        </li>
