        <h2>Who are you?</h2>
        <p>
          I am Lijukay, a hobby-developer, who is ready to learn anything. I
          have a great fable for things with rounded corner, a clean design and
          I love the aestethic of a white theme. In general I am trying to make
          everything as beautiful as possible. <br />I love Samsungs design as
          it is clean and beautiful. I also love Google's Material 3 design and
          I am even programming with it. Qwotable for example has it fully
          implemented (finally).

        <h2>What are you doing?</h2>
        <p>I am programming some things. Currently I am learning:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Java</li>
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h2>What do you have to offer?</h2>
      <p>
        Might not be much, but I am developing an application that displays
        quotes, its author and where it can be found. If you remember, I already
        named it here. It is called
        <a href="https://github.com/Lijukay/Qwotable/tree/master">Qwotable</a>
        <br />Besides Qwotable, I am working on other things, though they are
        not as high-priorisized as Qwotable:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Quotes M3: <br />&nbsp;Same as Qwotable but without wisdom and
          Material 3 is not correct implemented. Also support for quotes is
          outdated. Will work on it randomly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Quotes OneUI: <br />&nbsp;Same as Quotes M3 but in Samsung's unique
          OneUI-Design. It was not up-to-date and some features were and still
          are missing, but I am working on it more often.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Note that these applications are replaced but Qwotable and it is not
        guaranteed that they will get updates. But I am still offering support
        for them until end of 2023. Maybe even longer. Who knows ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
